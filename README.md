## Overview

The **Spotlight Effect Project** demonstrates a visually engaging spotlight effect that highlights grid sections as the user interacts with them. The goal of this project was to learn how to create and implement this effect, which tracks the cursor on hover or keyboard focus, adding interactivity and accessibility to the design.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Grid Layout**: The grid is built using CSS Grid, providing a structured and responsive layout.
- **Spotlight Effect**: A circular highlight dynamically follows the user's cursor or focused grid item, creating a smooth and interactive experience.
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support, ensuring that users relying on assistive technology can also experience the spotlight effect.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots to illustrate the project:

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Lighthouse

### What I learned

- **Spotlight Effect**: I created a spotlight effect on items in a grid layout using CSS. This effect dims the background while highlighting the item under the cursor.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: I utilized JavaScript to make the spotlight effect interactive. When the user hovers over an item, the spotlight adjusts in real-time to maintain focus on that item.

- **Accessibility Features**: I ensured the spotlight effect is accessible. Users can navigate using the keyboard, and the effect does not hinder screen reader functionality.

### Continued Development

Future improvements may include:

- Integrating additional animations to enhance the spotlight effect.
- Expanding the product grid with more items and varying content.
- Adding real product data and images from an API.
